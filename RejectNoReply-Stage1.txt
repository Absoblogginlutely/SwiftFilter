Name: RejectNoReply-Stage1
Description: When phishers take over other business email accounts, they send messages to all senders in the user's inbox, 
	to try to compromise known associates. We want to find non-automated replies to isolate these high-quality phishing
	messages for threat intelligence. Often customers will work with multiple employees, so it's also a detective control.
	The 2nd stage of this rule (see the other file) will delete the message without creating a reply loop.

Rules:
- The sender is outside the organization
- The recipient is: noreply@company.com

Exceptions:
- sender's address matches text patterns: <SET0>
- subject inlcudes words: <SET1>

Actions:
- Reject with message: This no-reply mailbox does not accept external email. Please contact us directly.
